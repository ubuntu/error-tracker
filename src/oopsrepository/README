I've now vendored this as part of the new error-tracker repository here:
https://github.com/canonical/error-tracker

This is in an effort to make all this stack work again on a Noble machine. As of
now, this is still running on Bionic, has never seen a Python 3 interpreter, and
nobody has been maintaining that for like at least 5 years:

I'll do my best to put that up to modern standards.

FAQs etc.

The code can be branch using bzr::
